Zero-Celsius (version -260Â°C)
======

Zero-Celsius is a rebalancing mod for Zero-K, which aims to improve how battles feel by easening up some of the micro-management-heavy units, by making confrontation not being always a choice for long-ranged type units, and bringing back some units back into the fray.

What is in this mod ? 

* Some units made more reliable by removing or improving some of their... more technically unreliable components (Yes physics engine, I'm looking right at you! And you too easy-going friendly fire!).
* A reinforcement on air units, especially the frail airplanes, to make them more viable -even if not ideal- opponents against AA defenses. Also, airplanes can be more played as heavy-fire support-forces than spec-ops focused on killing high priority targets.
* More unit combinations. A strider with two shield layers, with one being super-large? Check! A turtle-like bombardier that spreads doom at whatever is underneath it? Check!
* Some units just rebalanced to bring confrontations on the front, and not running and kiting one of your constant, micro-managing issues. This should also help with the AI being "too good for the player's good", being able to harass all your bases at the same time and eroding them slowly, while never trying to make a breach even if it has four times your power (and it knows it!).

What is not in this mod?

* Perfect balance. Of course, we try to keep any units from being overpowered, but we do not intend the mod to be perfectly tuned for competitive play (too much time expensive).
* No new models and animations. At most a new FX or two for some complete rework, but no more.
* Also no new units, although some of the existing ones will seem very different from the original ones.

Installation

Full details and troubleshoots incoming. I need to work on the rest of the balancing and fight nasty bugs first.

In the mean time, you can follow the wiki and use the TZeroCelsius.sdd folder as the zk.sdd folder : https://zero-k.info/mediawiki/index.php?title=Mod_Creation#Running_your_Mod

- Note : The TZeroCelsius folder needs to be renamed to zk.sdd folder, otherwise it doesn't work. Don't ask me why, I don't know x_x.
- Note 2 : Expect to have bugs until I iron them out. Editing even the units's configuration files (lest the scripting ones) seems to quickly create bugs if one is not careful.
